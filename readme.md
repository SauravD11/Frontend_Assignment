# Note: Please provide all necessary files in the base repo
if some assignments have both css and js files, please include those as well with the starter code

Folder name should be the Assignment problem

If base_repo has multiple files like css and js files, you can club them in a folder or list them individually as well, for e.g.

```
  css
    style1.css
    style2.css
  js
    script1.js
    script2.js
```

OR

```
style1.css
style2.css
script1.js
script2.js

```
